# wide-field-calcium-imaging-sleep-state-classification
Automated sleep state classification using deep learning and multiplex visibility graphs (MVGs) on wide-field calcium imaging (WFCI) data from mice.

#### Project Overview:
This project aims to automate the classification of sleep states using deep learning techniques applied to wide-field calcium imaging (WFCI) data obtained from mice. Traditionally, the classification of sleep states (wakefulness, non-REM, and REM) requires labor-intensive manual scoring of adjunct EEG and EMG signals, which can be invasive and time-consuming. By leveraging multiplex visibility graphs (MVGs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this project proposes an automated method to classify sleep states directly from WFCI data alone.
